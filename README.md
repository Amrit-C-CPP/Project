  - User-friendly interface: Ensures seamless interaction and integration.
  - Improved outcomes: Promotes faster decision-making and better patient care.
  - Workflow optimization: Ideal for clinical workflows with a focus on efficiency and reliability.
## üåêFeatures
  - Automated Detection: Quickly identifies fractures and highlights them in input medical images.
  - Confidence Scoring: Offers a confidence score to indicate the accuracy of each prediction.
  - Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use interface for seamless uploading and visualization of results.
  - Multi-platform Compatibility: Supports both desktop and mobile devices for flexible use across platforms.
## ü§ñTechnology Stack
  - Frontend: Built with React.js for a fast, responsive, and interactive user interface. Alternatively, Angular may be used for scalable and modular architecture, depending on project requirements.
  - Backend: Developed with Flask or Django, providing a robust framework for API handling, user authentication, and seamless communication between frontend and the machine learning model.
  - Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for efficient fracture detection. The model is fine-tuned using Transfer Learning with frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch 
    for improved accuracy in medical image analysis.
  - Database: A secure, scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for storing user data, uploaded images, and analysis results.
  - Security: Ensures data privacy and protection through SSL encryption for communication, and OAuth for secure authentication.
  - Cloud Integration: Supports cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud for scalable image storage, model hosting, and easy integration with other healthcare systems.
  - Version Control: Uses Git for version control to maintain codebase integrity and support team collaboration.
## üîçUsage
- Upload an X-ray image to the tool.
 - View the bounded irregular shape in the fracture area (if any) along with prediction details.
